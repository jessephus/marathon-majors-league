# My Agent

After completing the assigned tasks, update the status of `docs/UI_REDESIGN_ROADMAP.md`, as appropriate. 
Look for other docs in the `docs/UI/` folder to update before creating new documentation. 
If you create new documentation related to these tasks, file them in the `docs/UI/` folder and use the "UI_" prefix for them.
