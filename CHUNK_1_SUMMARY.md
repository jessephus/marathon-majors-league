# Chunk 1 Complete: Database Schema Extensions

## Summary

✅ **Chunk 1 is complete and ready for review!**

This first manageable chunk establishes the database foundation for richer athlete data and multi-race functionality. All changes are backward compatible and include automated migration for existing deployments.

## What Was Completed

### 1. Extended Athletes Table Schema
Added 5 new fields to support comprehensive athlete profiles:
- **`overall_rank`** - World Athletics overall ranking (INTEGER)
- **`age`** - Current age of athlete (INTEGER)
- **`date_of_birth`** - Birth date for age calculation (DATE)
- **`sponsor`** - Primary sponsor (VARCHAR 255) - *field ready, data to be populated later*
- **`season_best`** - Best marathon time in current season (VARCHAR 10)

All fields are nullable to support incremental data population.

### 2. New Races Table
Created table to track marathon events:
```sql
races (
  id, name, date, location, distance, event_type,
  world_athletics_event_id, description, is_active
)
```

**Initial data:** 2025 NYC Marathon automatically seeded during database initialization.

### 3. New Athlete-Race Junction Table
Created `athlete_races` table to link athletes to specific races:
```sql
athlete_races (
  athlete_id, race_id, bib_number, confirmed_at
)
```

**Initial data:** All 58 current athletes automatically linked to 2025 NYC Marathon.

### 4. New API Endpoint: `/api/races`
Complete race management functionality:
- **GET /api/races** - List all races
- **GET /api/races?active=true** - List active races only
- **GET /api/races?id=1** - Get specific race
- **GET /api/races?id=1&includeAthletes=true** - Get race with athletes
- **POST /api/races** - Create new race

### 5. Enhanced Database Functions
Added 10 new helper functions in `api/db.js`:
- `getAllRaces()`, `getActiveRaces()`, `getRaceById()`
- `createRace()`, `updateRace()`
- `linkAthleteToRace()`, `unlinkAthleteFromRace()`
- `getAthletesForRace()`, `getRacesForAthlete()`
- `seedNYMarathon2025()`

### 6. Automatic Migration
Updated `api/init-db.js` to handle existing deployments:
- Detects missing columns and adds them automatically
- Creates new tables if they don't exist
- Seeds 2025 NYC Marathon race
- Links all existing athletes to the race
- **Zero downtime** - works on first request to any API endpoint

### 7. Comprehensive Documentation
Created/updated 3 documentation files:
- **`docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA_EXTENSIONS.md`** - Complete migration guide with examples
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Updated with new schema and API endpoint
- **`README.md`** - Updated data structure and features sections

### 8. Automated Testing
Created `scripts/validate-schema.js` - validates:
- ✅ Schema syntax and completeness
- ✅ API function exports
- ✅ Endpoint structure
- ✅ Data compatibility
- ✅ All tests passing

## Files Changed

**Modified (5 files):**
- `schema.sql` - Extended schema with new fields and tables
- `api/db.js` - Added race management functions
- `api/init-db.js` - Enhanced migration logic
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Updated technical documentation
- `README.md` - Updated feature descriptions

**Created (3 files):**
- `api/races.js` - New races API endpoint
- `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA_EXTENSIONS.md` - Migration documentation
- `scripts/validate-schema.js` - Automated validation script

**Total:** 926 lines added, 23 lines removed

## Testing Performed

✅ All validation tests pass:
```
Test 1: Schema.sql structure ✅
Test 2: db.js exports ✅
Test 3: races.js endpoint ✅
Test 4: init-db.js updates ✅
Test 5: athletes.json compatibility ✅
```

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible:**
- Existing games continue to work unchanged
- New fields are optional (nullable)
- Auto-migration on first API request
- No manual intervention required
- No data loss

## What's Next (Future Chunks)

This foundation enables the following future work:

**Chunk 2: World Athletics Integration**
- Automated script to fetch top 100 men/women runners
- Data enrichment from World Athletics API
- Population of new athlete fields

**Chunk 3: Cron Job Automation**
- Scheduled data updates
- Serverless function for refreshing athlete data
- Keep rankings current

**Chunk 4: Frontend Ranking Table**
- Sortable table view with all stats
- Drag-and-drop ranking
- Enhanced player experience

**Chunk 5: Athlete Detail View**
- Modal/card with comprehensive athlete info
- Recent race logs
- World Athletics profile integration

## How to Test

### Testing on Vercel Deployment

1. **Trigger Migration (if needed):**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/init-db
   ```

2. **Verify Athletes API includes new fields:**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/athletes
   # Should include: overallRank, age, dateOfBirth, sponsor, seasonBest
   ```

3. **Test Races API:**
   ```bash
   # List all races
   curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/races
   
   # Get 2025 NYC Marathon with athletes
   curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/races?id=1&includeAthletes=true
   ```

4. **Verify Existing Functionality:**
   - Commissioner mode still works
   - Player ranking submission works
   - Draft functionality works
   - Results entry works

## Review Checklist

Before moving to Chunk 2, please verify:

- [ ] Schema changes deployed successfully
- [ ] Athletes API returns new fields (even if null)
- [ ] Races API accessible and returns 2025 NYC Marathon
- [ ] Existing game functionality unchanged
- [ ] No errors in Vercel function logs
- [ ] Documentation is clear and helpful

## Questions for Review

1. **Schema design** - Are the new fields appropriately typed?
2. **API design** - Is the races endpoint structure intuitive?
3. **Migration strategy** - Is the auto-migration approach acceptable?
4. **Documentation** - Is anything unclear or missing?
5. **Next steps** - Ready to proceed with Chunk 2 (World Athletics integration)?

**Status:** ✅ Chunk 1 Complete - Ready for Review
