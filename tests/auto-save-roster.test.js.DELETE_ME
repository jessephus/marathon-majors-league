# MARKED FOR DELETION

**Reason:** Feature not yet implemented

**From Audit (Issue #82):**
This test file covers auto-save roster functionality, but the feature is not implemented in the codebase. The tests are placeholder/aspirational tests for a future feature.

**Recommendation:** Remove or move to a "future-features" directory

**Alternative:** If auto-save is planned, keep as TODO with clear documentation that feature is not yet implemented.

**Decision:** @jessephus will decide whether to delete this file.
