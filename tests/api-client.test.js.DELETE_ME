# MARKED FOR DELETION (Enhance or Consolidate)

**Reason:** Minimal coverage, consider enhancement or consolidation

**From Audit (Issue #82):**
This test file provides minimal coverage of the API client module. The API client is also tested indirectly through integration tests in other suites.

**Coverage Analysis:**
- Current: Minimal unit tests of api-client wrapper
- Integration: API calls tested in api-endpoints.test.js, game-flow.test.js, etc.

**Recommendation:** Either enhance with comprehensive tests OR consolidate into api-endpoints.test.js

**Options:**
1. **Enhance:** Add comprehensive unit tests for:
   - Error handling
   - Retry logic
   - Request/response transformation
   - Cache integration
   
2. **Consolidate:** Merge into api-endpoints.test.js where API calls are already tested end-to-end

3. **Delete:** If API client is simple wrapper, integration tests may be sufficient

**Decision:** @jessephus will decide whether to:
1. Enhance this test file with more comprehensive coverage
2. Consolidate into api-endpoints.test.js
3. Delete if integration tests provide sufficient coverage
