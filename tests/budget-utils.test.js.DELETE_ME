# MARKED FOR DELETION (Consider Consolidation)

**Reason:** Covered by salary-cap-draft tests

**From Audit (Issue #82):**
This test file provides unit tests for budget utility functions. However, these same functions are comprehensively tested in integration within `salary-cap-draft.test.js`.

**Redundancy Analysis:**
- `budget-utils.test.js`: Tests pure utility functions in isolation
- `salary-cap-draft.test.js`: Tests the same functions in context of draft flow

**Recommendation:** Consider consolidation - the integration tests in salary-cap-draft may be sufficient. If keeping, document the value of having both unit and integration tests.

**Pros of keeping:**
- Pure unit tests are faster
- Tests utility functions in isolation
- Useful for debugging specific calculation issues

**Cons:**
- Duplication of test coverage
- Maintenance burden (2 test files for same functionality)

**Decision:** @jessephus will decide whether to:
1. Delete this file (rely on integration tests)
2. Keep this file (value in pure unit tests)
3. Consolidate (merge best tests from both)
