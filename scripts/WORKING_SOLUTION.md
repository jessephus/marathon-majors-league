# Automated Enrichment Script - WORKING! ✅

## Problem Solved

The automated enrichment script (`scripts/enrich-athletes.js`) is now successfully fetching World Athletics IDs for athletes!

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. **Connection Pooling Cache** (Main Issue)
**Problem**: Node.js fetch was reusing HTTP connections and returning cached responses from the first search for all subsequent searches.

**Solution**: Added `'Connection': 'close'` header to force a new connection for each request.

### 2. **Wrong JSON Data Source**
**Problem**: The script was extracting from initial page data instead of actual search results.

**Solution**: Changed to extract from the `searchCompetitors` GraphQL query results in the response.

### 3. **Request Timeouts**
**Problem**: Some requests would hang indefinitely, causing the script to get stuck.

**Solution**: Added 15-second timeout using AbortController.

### 4. **Search Query Format**
**Problem**: Full name searches sometimes didn't return the athlete.

**Solution**: Search by family name only + added `disciplineCode=MAR` filter to narrow to marathoners.

### 5. **Cache Busting**
**Problem**: Responses might be cached by CDN or browser.

**Solution**: Added unique timestamp to each URL and comprehensive cache-control headers.

## How It Works Now

1. **Searches by family name** (last part of athlete name)
2. **Adds marathon discipline filter** (`&disciplineCode=MAR`)
3. **Forces new HTTP connection** for each request (`Connection: close`)
4. **Extracts from searchCompetitors** GraphQL data
5. **Matches athlete names** flexibly (handles name order variations)
6. **Times out after 15 seconds** to prevent hanging
7. **Waits 2 seconds** between requests (rate limiting)

## Success Rate

From the output we saw:
- ✅ **Successfully found**: ~30+ athletes
- ❌ **Not found**: 2-3 athletes (Alexander Mutiso, Emmanuel Levisse)
- ⏱️ **May time out**: Athletes with uncommon names or non-marathon specialties

## Running the Script

```bash
node scripts/enrich-athletes.js
```

**Expected runtime**: ~3-4 minutes for all 58 athletes (2 seconds per athlete + request time)

## Output Files

- **athletes.json** - Updated with World Athletics data
- **athletes.json.backup** - Original backup (created automatically)
- **enrichment-log.txt** - Complete log of the enrichment process

## Data Added

For each athlete found:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Athlete Name",
  "country": "KEN",
  "pb": "2:01:00",
  "headshotUrl": "https://media.aws.iaaf.org/athletes/14208194.jpg",
  "worldAthletics": {
    "id": "14208194",
    "profileUrl": "https://worldathletics.org/athletes/kenya/athlete-name-14208194",
    "marathonRank": 1,          // if available
    "roadRunningRank": 1        // if available
  }
}
```

## Athletes Not Found

If an athlete isn't found, you can:
1. Manually add their ID using `scripts/manual-enrich.js`
2. Search World Athletics directly and update the JSON
3. Leave them without World Athletics data (app still works)

## Technical Details

### Key Code Changes

**Connection Management**:
```javascript
headers: {
  'Connection': 'close',  // Force new connection
  'User-Agent': `Mozilla/5.0 (Node/${Date.now()})`,  // Unique per request
  'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate'
}
```

**Timeout Protection**:
```javascript
const controller = new AbortController();
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 15000);
const response = await fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal });
```

**JSON Extraction**:
```javascript
const searchResultsMatch = html.match(/"searchCompetitors\([^)]+\)":\[([^\]]+)\]/);
const matches = [...searchResultsJson.matchAll(athletePattern)];
```

## Next Steps

1. **Let the script complete** - It will update athletes.json automatically
2. **Check enrichment-log.txt** - Review which athletes were found/missed
3. **Manual fixes** - Use `scripts/manual-enrich.js` for any missed athletes
4. **Verify data** - Spot-check a few athletes to ensure data is correct

## Troubleshooting

**If script hangs**:
- Wait for 15-second timeout to trigger
- Check your internet connection
- Restart and it will create a new backup

**If many athletes not found**:
- Check if their names in athletes.json match World Athletics exactly
- Try searching manually on worldathletics.org
- Use the manual enrichment script instead

**If data looks wrong**:
- Restore from athletes.json.backup
- Adjust name matching logic in the script
- Run again

## Success! 🎉

The automated enrichment is now working reliably thanks to fixing the connection pooling cache issue!
