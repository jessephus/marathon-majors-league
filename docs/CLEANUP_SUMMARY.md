- Historical context maintained in MIGRATION.md and CHANGELOG.md
- Technical details retained in appropriate locations

### âœ… Improved Accessibility
- Multiple ways to find documentation (role, topic, question)

- Quick reference for common scenarios

## Recommendations for Future

### Documentation Maintenance
1. **Update docs/README.md** when adding new documentation
2. **Check for redundancy** before creating new doc files
3. **Archive historical docs** instead of deleting (if needed)
4. **Keep CHANGELOG.md current** with notable changes

### Content Guidelines
1. **Single source of truth** - Don't duplicate information
2. **Cross-reference** - Link to authoritative documents
3. **Keep current** - Remove obsolete content promptly
4. **Role-focused** - Write for specific audiences

### Organization Principles
1. **docs/README.md** serves as the index
2. **Main README.md** provides overview and quick links
3. **Each file has clear, singular purpose**
4. **No "summary" or "completion" docs** (use CHANGELOG instead)
