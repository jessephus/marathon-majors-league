  - New `league_standings` table for cached leaderboard
  - New `records_audit` table for record status tracking
  - New `race_records` table for course and world records
  - Enhanced `race_results` with placement, points, splits, and breakdown data
- API endpoints for scoring system
  - `/api/scoring` for calculation and record management
  - `/api/standings` for leaderboard with caching
  - Auto-scoring on result entry
- Frontend UI enhancements
  - Points breakdown tooltips and modal displays
  - Record badges (WR/CR) with provisional indicators
  - Enhanced team cards showing total points and rankings
  - Responsive points leaderboard table
  - Fallback to legacy time-based display for compatibility
- Comprehensive documentation for points scoring system
- Migration script with utility functions and seeded records

### Changed
- Results API now auto-triggers scoring calculation
- Team cards enhanced with points display alongside legacy time display
- Leaderboard prioritizes points-based standings with fallback

### Technical
- Scoring engine module with modular calculation functions
- Database helper functions for scoring rules and standings
- Version 2 scoring rules with configurable parameters
- Tie handling using standard competition ranking
- Record detection and provisional workflow

### Fixed
- `/api/results` now tolerates legacy payloads and stores expanded scoring data, and `race_results` schema is auto-migrated to include all scoring columns.
- Fixed a regression where fantasy standings and team detail cards always showed 0 pts by auto-triggering the points engine on results/standings fetches and enriching responses with athlete metadata so every recorded finisher appears in Race Results.

## Migration Notes

### From v1.0 to v2.0 (Database Migration)
This major version introduced significant changes to the data storage system:

**Before (Postgres)**:
- Complex SQL queries and table relationships
- JSONB fields for storing rankings and team data
- Required database initialization and schema management

**After (Blob Storage)**:
- Simple JSON file storage with direct fetch operations
- Namespace isolation using gameId prefixes
- No database initialization required

**Data Migration**:
- Existing deployments will start with empty data after upgrade
- No automatic migration path due to storage architecture changes
- Users need to re-enter game data after upgrading

**Breaking Changes**:
- API response formats remain the same (backward compatible frontend)
- Environment variable changes (POSTGRES_URL â†’ BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN)
- Deployment process simplified (no database provisioning step)

### Benefits of Migration
1. **Simplified Development**: No SQL complexity, just JSON operations
2. **Easier Debugging**: Direct file access in Vercel dashboard
3. **Reduced Dependencies**: Removed @vercel/postgres dependency
4. **Better Fit**: Data was already JSON in Postgres JSONB fields
5. **Cost Effective**: Blob storage included in Vercel Hobby plan
6. **No Setup Required**: Automatic storage provisioning

## Development History

### Project Evolution
The Fantasy NY Marathon project evolved from a simple proof-of-concept to a fully-featured fantasy sports application:

1. **Initial Concept**: Basic athlete selection and team formation
2. **Draft System**: Implementation of fair snake draft algorithm
3. **Real-time Features**: Live result tracking and standings
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interface for race day usage
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for users and developers

### Architecture Decisions

#### Storage Evolution
- **v1.0**: Chose Postgres for structured data and ACID compliance
- **v2.0**: Migrated to Blob Storage for simplicity and better fit with JSON data model

#### Frontend Simplicity
- **Decision**: No build tools or frameworks
- **Rationale**: Simplicity, fast deployment, minimal dependencies
- **Result**: Direct file deployment with excellent performance

#### Authentication Model
- **Decision**: Player codes instead of user accounts
- **Rationale**: Casual friend-to-friend use case doesn't need complex auth
- **Result**: Zero-friction user experience with adequate security

#### Mobile-First Design
- **Decision**: Optimize for phone usage during marathon watching
- **Rationale**: Primary use case is following race on mobile device
- **Result**: Excellent mobile experience with responsive design

### Future Roadmap

#### Short Term (Next Release)
- [ ] WebSocket integration for real-time updates without refresh
- [ ] Enhanced error handling and offline support
- [ ] Performance optimizations for mobile devices
- [ ] Additional athlete data fields (age, sponsor, world ranking)
