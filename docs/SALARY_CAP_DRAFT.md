# Salary Cap Draft System

## Overview

The **Salary Cap Draft** is a daily fantasy-style team building system where players directly select their team of athletes within a fixed budget constraint. This provides a different strategic experience compared to the traditional snake draft.

## How It Works

### Basic Rules

- **Salary Cap**: Each team has a **$30,000** budget
- **Team Size**: Must draft exactly **6 athletes** (3 men + 3 women)
- **Direct Selection**: Players choose athletes directly (no ranking/auto-draft)
- **Budget Constraint**: Total team cost must not exceed $30,000

### Athlete Pricing

Athletes are assigned salaries based on a comprehensive algorithm that considers:

1. **Personal Best Time (40% weight)**
   - Athletes closer to world record times cost more
   - Elite PBs (within 3% of WR): Premium pricing
   - Good PBs (3-6% off WR): Mid-tier pricing
   - Decent PBs (6-10% off WR): Value pricing

2. **Marathon World Ranking (30% weight)**
   - Top 10: Premium
   - 11-25: High tier
   - 26-50: Mid tier
   - 51-100: Value tier
   - 100+: Budget tier

3. **Road Running Ranking (15% weight)**
   - Broader track record consideration

4. **Overall World Athletics Ranking (10% weight)**
   - General athletic performance indicator

5. **Season Form (5% weight)**
   - Recent performance vs. personal best
   - Athletes in good form get slight boost

### Pricing Examples

**Elite Athletes ($7k-$14k)**
- Top 10 world-ranked marathoners
- Sub-2:03 men, Sub-2:15 women
- Recent major marathon winners

**Mid-Tier Athletes ($3k-$7k)**
- Ranked 11-50 globally
- Proven performers with good PBs
- Consistent top-20 finishers

**Value Athletes ($1.5k-$3k)**
- Ranked 50+
- Debut marathoners with potential
- Lower-tier elite runners

## User Interface

### Budget Tracker

At the top of the screen, a prominent budget display shows:
- **Total Cap**: $30,000
- **Spent**: Current team cost
- **Remaining**: Available budget

Visual feedback:
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Plenty of budget remaining
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Low budget (<$5,000)
- ðŸ”´ Red (pulsing): Over budget

### Selected Team Display

Shows your current roster split by gender:
- **Men (X/3)**: List of selected male athletes
- **Women (X/3)**: List of selected female athletes

Each athlete card shows:
- Name
- Country flag
- World ranking
- Personal best
- Salary

Quick remove button (Ã—) to drop athletes from team.

### Athlete Browser

Browse and search all available athletes:

**Filters**:
- Gender: All / Men / Women
- (Future: Country, ranking range, price range)

**Sort Options**:
- Price (High to Low) - default
- Price (Low to High)
- Ranking (Best to Worst)
- Name (A-Z)

**Search**:
- Search by athlete name or country

**Athlete Cards** display:
- Name and salary (prominent)
- Country and gender
- World ranking badge
- Personal best badge
- "Add to Team" button (disabled if over budget or roster full)

### Strategic Indicators

- Athletes you can't afford show "Over Budget"
- Position limits enforced (3 men, 3 women max)
- Budget violations prevent team submission
- Progress bar shows team completion (X/6 athletes)

## Team Building Strategy

### Sample Team Configurations

**Elite Heavy Team** (~$51k - NOT POSSIBLE)
- Top 3 men + Top 3 women
- Forces strategic compromises

**Balanced Team** (~$29k - IDEAL)
- 1-2 elite athletes ($10k+)
- 2-3 mid-tier athletes ($4-7k)
- 1-2 value picks ($1.5-3k)
- Leaves small buffer for adjustments

**Value Team** (~$17k)
- Focus on lower-tier athletes
- Leaves significant budget unused
- Less competitive but within cap

**Optimal Strategy**:
1. Pick 1-2 elite "anchor" athletes
2. Fill remaining slots with value picks
3. Leave small budget buffer ($500-$1,000)
4. Balance men and women strategically

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Salary column added to athletes table
ALTER TABLE athletes 
ADD COLUMN salary INTEGER DEFAULT 5000;

-- New table for salary cap teams
CREATE TABLE salary_cap_teams (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  game_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  player_code VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  athlete_id INTEGER REFERENCES athletes(id),
  gender VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  total_spent INTEGER NOT NULL,
  submitted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### API Endpoints

**GET /api/salary-cap-draft?gameId={id}**
- Retrieves submitted salary cap teams for a game
- Returns team composition and spending for each player

**POST /api/salary-cap-draft**
- Submits a salary cap team
- Validates:
  - Team composition (3 men, 3 women)
  - Salary cap compliance
  - Athlete IDs validity
- Returns confirmation and spending summary

### Salary Calculation

Salary calculation script: `scripts/calculate-athlete-salaries.js`

```bash
# Calculate and update all athlete salaries
node scripts/calculate-athlete-salaries.js

# Or using database migration
node scripts/migrate-add-salaries.js
```

Formula:
```javascript
score = (PB_score * 0.4) + 
        (marathon_rank_score * 0.3) + 
        (road_rank_score * 0.15) + 
        (overall_rank_score * 0.1) + 
        (season_form_score * 0.05)

salary = MIN_SALARY + 
         (MAX_SALARY - MIN_SALARY) * 
         (score / 100) ^ 1.2

// Round to nearest $100
salary = round(salary / 100) * 100
```

**Configuration**:
- MIN_SALARY: $1,500
- MAX_SALARY: $14,000
- Exponent: 1.2 (creates separation between tiers)

### Client-Side Validation

Real-time checks as users build teams:
- âœ… Budget tracking updates on every add/remove
- âœ… Disable "Add" buttons when over budget
- âœ… Disable "Add" buttons when position full
- âœ… Visual feedback for budget status
- âœ… "Submit" button only enabled when valid

### Server-Side Validation

Final validation before saving:
- âœ… Verify exactly 3 men and 3 women
- âœ… Recalculate total from database salaries
- âœ… Confirm total â‰¤ $30,000
- âœ… Verify all athlete IDs exist
- âœ… Prevent duplicate athletes

## Differences from Snake Draft

| Feature | Snake Draft | Salary Cap Draft |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Selection Method** | Auto-draft from rankings | Direct selection |
| **Constraints** | Draft order, availability | Budget cap |
| **Strategy** | Ranking preference order | Budget allocation |
| **Control** | Indirect (via rankings) | Direct (pick any athlete) |
| **Fairness** | Snake order randomized | Budget constraint equalizes |
| **Speed** | Instant (automated) | Manual (player-paced) |

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjust salaries based on draft popularity
2. **Auction Draft**: Bidding system instead of fixed prices
3. **Salary Floor**: Require minimum spending (e.g., $25k)
4. **Position Scarcity**: Adjust pricing based on depth at position
5. **Injury Updates**: Reduce price for injured/scratched athletes
6. **Historical Performance**: Factor in past NYC Marathon results
7. **Form Trends**: Recent race results affect pricing
8. **Country Limits**: Optional constraint on athletes per country

## Testing

Manual test checklist:
- [ ] Create team and navigate to salary cap draft
- [ ] Add athletes to team
- [ ] Verify budget updates correctly
- [ ] Try to exceed budget (should prevent)
- [ ] Try to add 4th male athlete (should prevent)
- [ ] Remove athletes and verify budget updates
- [ ] Search for athletes
- [ ] Filter by gender
- [ ] Sort by different criteria
- [ ] Submit complete team
- [ ] Verify server validates team
- [ ] Check team appears in database
- [ ] Reload page and verify team persists

## Troubleshooting

**"Salary column not found"**
- Run migration: `node scripts/migrate-add-salaries.js`

**"All athletes show $5,000"**
- Salaries not calculated yet
- Run: `node scripts/calculate-athlete-salaries.js`

**"Can't submit team"**
- Verify exactly 3 men and 3 women selected
- Check total cost â‰¤ $30,000
- Ensure all athletes have valid IDs

**"Athletes don't load"**
- Check database connection
- Verify athletes table has data
- Check browser console for API errors
